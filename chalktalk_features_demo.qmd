::: {.fragment tts-script="Welcome to the ChalkTalk demo, where I'll show some key features of ChalkTalk."}
:::

::: {.fragment tts-script="ChalkTalk is an open source tool that combines the best features of Quarto, Reveal JS and text-to-speech into a tool that everyone, including AIs, can use."}
ðŸŽ¯ The goal: combine Quarto, Reveal, TTS and AI assistance to create engaging presentations fast
:::




## Using Fragments and TTS

::: {.fragment tts-script="Here's how to use fragments with text-to-speech in your presentations."}
:::

::: {.fragment tts-script="Start a div with the class 'fragment' and include your speech text in the tts-script attribute."}
The basic syntax looks like this:

```markdown
::: {.fragment tts-script="Your speech text here"}
Your visible content here
:::
```
:::

::: {.fragment tts-script="Remember, the speech text can be different from the displayed text, allowing you to provide additional context or explanations."}
Text â‰  Speech
:::


## Fragment Examples

::: {.fragment tts-script="Fragments can enhance various types of content in your slides."}
You can use fragments with:
:::

::: {.fragment tts-script="Regular text and bullet points to reveal information step by step."}
- Regular text
:::

::: {.fragment tts-script="Code blocks to walk through code examples incrementally."}
- Code blocks and examples
:::

::: {.fragment tts-script="Images to introduce visuals at the perfect moment, like this one of three penguin species."}
- Images

## Layout Features

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.fragment tts-script="ChalkTalk supports various layout options including multi-column layouts"}
- Column 1
- With bullets
- And content

## Code Example

::: {.fragment tts-script="Let's see how to add text-to-speech to a code block. The following Python code defines a dictionary with key-value pairs."}

```{python}
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
```
:::

::: {.fragment tts-script="We can access the value associated with a specific key like this."}

```{python}
print(my_dict["age"])  # Output: 30
```
:::

## Math Example

::: {.fragment tts-script="You can also add text-to-speech to mathematical equations. For example, here's the quadratic formula."}

The quadratic formula:

$$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$
:::

## Plot Example

::: {.fragment tts-script="Now, let's include a plot using data from the palmerpenguins dataset. Here is the code:"}

```{r}
#
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(palmerpenguins)

p <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
    geom_point() +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title = "Penguin Size Comparison",
         x = "Flipper Length (mm)",
         y = "Body Mass (g)")

```

:::

::: {.fragment tts-script="And here is the plot:"}

```{r}
p
```

:::

::: {.fragment tts-script="This is a famous plot in the data visualization community."}

:::

## Conclusion

::: {.fragment tts-script="Thank you for exploring these advanced features with us. Enjoy creating dynamic and engaging presentations with ChalkTalk."}
