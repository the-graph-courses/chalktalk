## Welcome

::: {.fragment ttv="Welcome to this guide on using ChalkTalk. As you can see, ChalkTalk allows you to convert text to engaging presentations, with audio, animated slides, and video avatars."}
:::

## Using Fragments and TTS

::: {.fragment tts="Here's the basic syntax for ChalkTalk. You initiate a div with the class 'fragment' and then you include your speech text in the tts attribute."}
The basic syntax looks like this:
```markdown
::: {.fragment tts="Your speech text here"}
Your visible content here
:::
```
:::

::: {.fragment tts="The speech text can be different from the displayed text!"}
Text â‰  Speech
:::

::: {.fragment tts="For videos, you use the TTV attribute instead of TTS."}

```markdown
::: {.fragment ttv="Your speech text here"}
:::
```

:::

## Fragment Examples

::: {.fragment tts="You can use fragments with different types of content"}
You can use fragments with:
:::

::: {.fragment tts="Regular text and paragraphs"}
- Regular text
:::

::: {.fragment tts="Code blocks and examples. This is kind of our target use case at the moment."}
- Code blocks and examples
:::

::: {.fragment tts="And you can add images, like this one of a cat"}
- Images

## Code Example

::: {.fragment tts="Here, we add text to speech to a code block. The Python code below defines a dictionary with a key-value pair."}

```{python}
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
```
:::

::: {.fragment tts="We can access the value associated with the key `age`. Note that the code can actually be executed when you render the slide."}
```{python}
my_dict["age"]
```
:::

## Math Example

::: {.fragment tts="You can even add text to speech to mathematical equations. For example, here's the quadratic formula. Do you remember how to use it?"}

The quadratic formula:
$$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$
